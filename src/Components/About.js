      <h3>About Us</h3>
          <p> We are a couple of girls from New York who love coffee. We are also the children of the unmedicated and self-medicated. For us, coffee was a quiet moment in a chaotic day, a safety blanket when things weren't safe, and a default invitation for the socially awkward who never mastered the "invite people to do stuff" thing. (Is there a class for that somewhere?). </p> 
          <p> Now, we're hoping coffee can also be a medium for discussions around mental health--and, frankly, a creative outlet for the more creative in our company. Maybe, one day, our coffee can also be a resource to improve mental health in our country. In the meantime, 20% of all profits are donated to the various organizations who provide research and other resources to do just that. So stop by and enjoy a cup of coffee--ideally, with a thoughtful giggle. </p>
      <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
            <p>Emotional Support Coffee is a small, family-owned business that believes in the power of coffee to bring people together. We also believe in the power of humor to overcome adversity. We are committed to providing the highest quality coffee beans and the best customer service in the most amusing packaging. We are passionate about coffee and mental health, and we want to share that passion with you.</p>
      <h3>Our Coffee</h3>
      <h4> Our Roasts </h4>
            <p> We roast our coffee beans in small batches to ensure the highest quality. We offer four roast levels: light, medium, dark, and a carefully crafted blend by our most anxious and perfectionism-driven coffee humans. Each bag is delicious--their self-worth depends on it. </p>
      <h4> Our Beans </h4>
            <p> We source our beans from small, family-owned farms in South America: we are committed to fair trade and sustainable farming practices. But we also love the personal touch and quality that comes from dealing directly with family owned farms. </p>
            <p> It is thanks to these farms that we can produce fine (and affordable) single-origin and blended-origin coffees that bring joy to those in need of coffee. </p>
      <h4> Our Packaging </h4>
            <p> We package our coffee in 15 oz. bags. </p>
            <p> We would also like to tell you that our bags are 100% sustainable and 100% recyclable. But those industry standards are confusing and full of strange and dubious loopholes. So, instead, we will say this: we are committed to being as genuinely (not "technically") sustainable as possible while still being pretty, inexpensive, and able to sit on your shelf long enough to be finished...without being able to sit in a landfill long enough to witness the extinction of the human race.</p>
